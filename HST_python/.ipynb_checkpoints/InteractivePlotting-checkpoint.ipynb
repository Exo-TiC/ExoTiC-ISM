    "Interactive plotting is a bit different when you use it in interactive Python (ipython), a notebook or when you run a script. I am not sure how much notebooks actually support interactive plotting at all, but it seemed easier to plug my examples into a notebook and then you can go ahead and copy-paste the code into an actual script, run it and see how it goes.\n",
