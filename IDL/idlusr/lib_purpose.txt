  The purpose of the IDL library IDLUSR is to hold routines
  thought to be of general interest to the author and other
  IDL users.  Many of these routines are useful at the interactive
  command mode of IDL.  Many are also useful in building other
  routines.  Very specialized routines, or those of only local
  interest are excluded from this library.
