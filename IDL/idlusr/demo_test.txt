*  area delimited by the <menu> </menu> pair.
*  Each menu item is on one line and consists of a tag
*  and a label.  The tag is used to reference a section

<ov>
gen_dropmenu is used to generate one or more drop-down
help menus.  It is called in the widget layout section
of a widget routine.  More details are given in the section
on How to use.

This routine takes two arguments. The main call is:
    gen_dropmenu, base_wid, file
      base_wid = the widget ID of the base where the menus
        are displayed.
      file = the name of the menu layout file.

To see an example layout file do
    gen_dropmenu,/details

To see a demo do
     gen_dropmenu,/demo
         or
     gen_dropmenu,demo=test_file
         which will try to display the specified file.
</ov>

<fil>
If the input is a file then it should have the following format.
Null lines and comments (* in first character) are allowed
and ignored.

The file has two main sections, a menu setup area, and a help text
area.  The order doesn't matter but the menu setup area should
probably come first.

The menu setup area consists of lines of text between <menu>
and </menu>.  Each line of text has a one word tag and a label
which may be multiple words.

The help text area contains the lines of text between <tag>
</tag> pairs where the tags were defined in the menu setup area.
</fil>

<txt>
The input may be a text array with the same format as the text file.
</txt>

<use>
In the widget layout part of a routine call gen_dropmenu after setting
up a base to contain the drop-down menu(s).
