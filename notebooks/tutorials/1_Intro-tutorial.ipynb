ExoTiC-ISM uses the **chi-squared** statistic and the **Levenberg-Marquardt** optimizer, which you can read more about in [Wakeford et al. (2016)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...819...10W/abstract) and in the `sherpa` documentation, as well as in any standard sources for least-squares optimisations.\n",

To make sure this works, we can instantiate a simple transit model based on a simple data set that we will create here.\n",
